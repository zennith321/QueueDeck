## QueueDeck

This plugin gives you full control over matchmaking all through commands. This means you can bind these commands to certain hotkeys to select/deselect playlists, start/stop matchmaking, start searching in a specific playlist, and even change regions! All of these commands will work anywhere whether it be in freeplay or right after a match has ended.

### Example
Let's say you wanted to bind a combination of the commands from this plugin to a singular button on your keyboard.
In this example I'll show you how to search for both standard and doubles in casual automatically.

First you would create your own `example.cfg` file in `bakkesmod\cfg` and name it whatever you'd like.
In that config file you would put the following commands:

(Please note that all `Search Commands` do all the following below automatically, just making all possible combinations into commands wouldn't be feasible, so this is how you would do a completely custom version of selecting and queuing)
```
queue_view_casual // It's important to set the view tab first or searching will not work properly, you don't need to do this for "queue_search_cstandard" related commands as it does this automatically
queue_deselect_casual // Optional, this would deselect any playlists you had selected previously that you might have forgotten
queue_select_cstandard
queue_select_cdoubles
queue_search
```

This sets the view tab to casual, deselects all casual playlists, selects both standard and doubles, then starts searching for those playlists.

Now to bind that file to a button you would do this in the BakkesMod console.
```
bind NumPadOne "exec example.cfg";writeconfig
```
Ta-da! You now have you own custom queue config that's bound to the one button on your numpad.
